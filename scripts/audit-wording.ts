// Wording-variation audit — run with: bun scripts/audit-wording.ts
//
// Reconsidered version of the "flag repeated prompt formulas" idea (originally
// suggestion #18). The first design was wrong, and this file records why:
//
//   · Flagging repeated `prompt` strings punishes a feature. The guidebook asks for
//     the opposite in one place — "we can also make an effort to be consistent in the
//     way we cue, so that the learner picks up on our cues more intuitively
//     throughout the length of a course" (§1.8). A stable widget label ("Which
//     English is built the German way?") is a cue the learner is *meant* to learn.
//
//   · Masked repetition (§1.7) is about not feeling repetitive, not about never
//     saying the same sentence. A lint on boilerplate trains agents to add noise
//     to silence it, which is strictly worse than the rot it was meant to catch.
//
// What actually rots is *explanatory prose*: an `explanation` copied verbatim into
// two lessons, or a pattern sentence pasted unchanged into adjacent lessons. That is
// decay an author cannot see, and it makes the trail feel machine-assembled.
//
// This audit therefore checks three things, exact-match only (no fuzzy thresholds —
// no false positives, no noise to argue about):
//
//   1. `explanation` strings repeated in ≥2 lessons that are adjacent in trail order.
//   2. Sentences in `pattern.content` / `hook.content` repeated in adjacent lessons.
//   3. An identical `prompt` for the same exercise type in ≥4 consecutive trail
//      nodes — a cap, with an explicit allowlist for the deliberately-stable labels.
//
// Zero drift is the goal: not "every string unique", but "no prose is copy-pasted
// between neighbours".
