# Audit triage — October 2026

The October audit of lessons 5121–5312 produced 39 findings. They were sorted with the
rule in [`NORTH_STAR.md`](./NORTH_STAR.md): fix what blocks or misleads a learner of German;
log (don't do) what only refines etymology.

## Done

| Area | What changed |
|---|---|
| Unfinishable exercises | 8 tile exercises could not be completed (a word needed twice with one tile, or a pronoun with no tile): l901_e1, l902_e1, l5162_e5, l5192_e4, l5201_e4, l5202_e4, l5211_e5, l5252_e4. Tiles added. |
| Grading | Commas inside a sentence are ignored (tiles can't produce them; l5211_e4 / l5212_e4 were marked wrong on a perfect answer). `das`+`Wass`+`er` is read as one word (lessons 5, 102, 901, 902 were graded "almost" + forced retry). |
| Playability | 11 matching exercises with 13–23 pairs trimmed to 12 (median is 6); each lesson's headline words kept. |
| German correctness | küssst → küsst, tringe → trinke, "Manchmal trinke ich immer Kaffee", "geradeaus nach rechts", Schwarz und Weiß, "Himmel the ceiling", false "zu = too, nach = to" hint, 5272 mixed frames. |
| Taught-first | 5291 `schneidet` (untaught), 5021_e3/e5 untaught antidote words, `langweilig` credited in l2903. |
| Practice matches lesson | l202_e5 restored to a bracket sentence; l301_e5 / l401_e5 restored to their shift-bearing lines. |
| Presence | suppe (5222), abfahrt/ankunft (5261), socke (5292), Französisch (5291) now appear in an exercise. |
| Text matches lesson | 5211 teaser + 5212 blurb (Ofen), stale sentence counts, garbled shell blurbs, 5251 footnote, 501_e5 explanation. |
| Guards | Tests: tile exercises solvable, matching ≤ 12 pairs, grader comma/tile behaviour. |

## Essence pass — anti-drift (North Star audit)

Six exercises had drifted into etymology trivia where the answer required knowledge
unrelated to German (Middle English phonology, Latin/Greek roots, KJV English) and no
corresponding German was practised. Converted to German practice; the connection stays as
a one-line hook in the explanation:

- l18_e2 (Middle English y-) → pick the ge- participle that closes the Perfekt bracket (gemacht).
- l1905_e4 (KJV "wist") → which verb freezes to wusste (wissen).
- l5171_e3 (Latin aurora) → Osten's everyday English twin (east).
- l5181_e2 (clavichord) → which instrument das Klavier names (piano).
- l5182_e3 (Greek théatron → theory) → which place das Theater names (theater).
- l5232_e3 (Greek "honey-apple") → which spread die Marmelade names (jam).

Deliberately left: reverse-cognate twins that are taught in-lesson and map to the German
word being learned (warum↔wherefore, wohin↔whither, heiße↔hight, genug/enough, methinks),
and all loan-vs-native classification quizzes — the prose teaches them; the recall
reinforces the German word.

## Deliberately not done (etymology precision — see North Star)

- #14 shift-badge nuance (Dezember z, hinten d→t, …)
- #15 Zucker / Arabic loan chain
- #30 `shift_categories` orphans (frozen field; prose-only etymologies)
- #32 `reverse_cognate` dual-use relabelling and option-label leaks
- #33 "soften the partly-true set" (dort, Computer, Kanne, lila, …)
- #34 blurb nits that were purely etymological (kept only the ones that were garbled or false on the page)
- #35 beyond the "four prefixes" wording; #36 cosmetics about Latin/Greek labels and Kleid↔cloth hedging
- #37 / #38 watch-item and a cosmetic slug (`l5151`, frozen)
- #21 `Rad` is already glossed inline in 5251 — no change needed

## Left as is, on purpose

- #29 `word_ids` "dead" entries (hundert, minute @5122; zeit, morgen, garten @5132; bad @5212): the words are taught in the
  lesson prose but have no exercise line. Removing them risks the 650-word floor; adding pairs would break the 12-pair cap.
  Revisit only if a learner-facing reason appears. The "used-but-unlisted" words (regnen, fallen, wand) are already taught earlier.
- Matching pairs duplicated between a core lesson and its side lesson (single-word recap pairs) — that is the recap design.
