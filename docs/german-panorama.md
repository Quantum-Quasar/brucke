# German Panorama — structure → lesson map

> The repo artifact companion to `/panorama` (the in-app reference layer).
>
> The Atlas (`/atlas`) is a **phonological** panorama: nine consonant shifts, one per family. This document is the **grammatical** one: every structure German is built from, mapped to the lesson ids that teach it.
>
> **The `taught` / `inferred` column is the point of the file.** The Thinking Method's trust promise is *"we will revisit everything they are uncertain of"* — which only holds if you can tell, for any structure, whether the learner has actually been taught it or is expected to have inferred it. Anything marked `inferred` is a place where the trail is asking the learner to make a leap it never showed them, and it is the honest backlog list.

## How to read this

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `taught` | a lesson states the law outright — pattern card, hook, or an exercise that grades it |
| `inferred` | the structure appears in graded answers but no lesson names the law |
| `partial` | the law is named, but only inside a footnote, a trap note, or a single exercise |

## 1. The four cases

| Structure | Taught in | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Nominative (subject) | 10, 1001 | taught |
| Accusative (direct object) | 10, 1003, 402, 5051 | taught |
| The Him-Case (`der → den`, `er → ihn`) | 10, 1002, 1003 | taught |
| Dative (indirect object) | 20, 2001, 2003, 2903 | taught |
| `mir ist kalt` — the dative experiencer | 2903 | taught |
| Two-way prepositions: motion picks the case | 27, 5051, 2701, 2702 | taught |
| Genitive (possession) | — | **inferred** |

The genitive is the one real hole. It appears in the panorama's diagram because a learner will meet `des`/`der` in reading, but no lesson on the trail names it. The frame is already installed — `des` is `D- + *seiner*`, exactly the same decomposition as `der = D- + *er*` — so it needs one sprig, not a topic.

## 2. The article as a pronoun wearing a hat

| Structure | Taught in | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `der` = D- + `er`, `die` = D- + `sie`, `das` = D- + `es` | 1003 | taught |
| The pronoun test (which pronoun replaces the noun?) | 1003, 10 | taught |
| The ein-family marches in step with der/die/das | 11, 1101 | taught |
| `die` does two jobs: feminine *and* plural | 1003 (footnote), 23 | partial |
| The article flags case, not gender-as-meaning | 1003 (trap note) | taught |

## 3. The verb bracket (Satzklammer)

| Structure | Taught in | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Modal opens position 2, bare infinitive closes | 2, 202 | taught |
| Perfekt: auxiliary in position 2, participle at the end | 18, 1904 | taught |
| Separable prefix flies to the end | 15, 1501, 1502, 1601, 1602 | taught |
| `weil` / `dass` send the verb to the basement | 14, 1402, 1401 | taught |
| Verb-second in main clauses | 14, 1401 | taught |
| Time–Manner–Place ordering (TeKaMoLo) | 2703 | taught |
| Konjunktiv II (`hätte`, `würde`) | 5081 | taught |

## 4. The adjective's definite feeling

| Structure | Taught in | Status |
|---|---|---|
| One flag per noun phrase | 2403 | taught |
| Adjective copies the article's ending when `ein` is quiet | 2403 | taught |
| `-er` echoes `der`, `-es` echoes `das` | 2403 | taught |
| Strong declension when no article stands in front | 2404 | taught |
| Predicate adjectives take no ending | 2403 (footnote), 1003 | partial |

## 5. Tense, mood and aspect

| Structure | Taught in | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Present tense (one form, two English habits) | 2, 12, 2403 | taught |
| Perfekt as the spoken past | 18, 1904 | taught |
| Strong verbs (ablaut) | 19, 1901, 1902, 1905, 5041 | taught |
| Weak past `-te` and its English `-ed` twin | 1904, 5082 | taught |
| Konjunktiv II | 5081 | taught |
| Passive voice | — | **inferred** |

The passive is out of the trail's declared scope, so `inferred` here means "not promised" rather than "missing". It is listed so the promise stays honest.

## 6. The nine consonant shifts

| Shift | Core | Sprigs / drills | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| th → d | 4 | 402, 5161 | taught |
| k → ch | 6 | 602 | taught |
| d → t | 7 | 702 | taught |
| p → pf / f | 3 | — | taught |
| t → z / ss | 5 | — | taught |
| g → gh / ch | 26 | 2601, 2602, 2603 | taught |
| v → b | 25 | 2501, 2502 | taught |
| b → p (final) | 25 | — | taught |
| gh → silent in English, sounded in German | 26 | 2601, 602 | taught |

## 7. Number and the noun

| Structure | Taught in | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Five plural patterns | 23, 2302 | taught |
| The umlaut as the plural's vowel signal | 23, 2301 | taught |
| `die` is the plural article, whatever the drawer | 23, 2302, 1003 | taught |
| Compound gender comes from the head word | 21, 2101, 2102, 2103 | taught |
| Diminutive `-chen` always makes `das` | 22, 5232 | taught |
| `-ung` is always feminine | 2201 | taught |

## 8. Negation

| Structure | Taught in | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `nicht` for verbs and adjectives | 12 | taught |
| `kein` for noun phrases | 12, 1201 | taught |
| `kein` declines like `ein` | 12, 1201 | taught |
| `sondern` for negate-and-correct | 1202 | taught |

## The honest backlog

Everything marked **inferred**:

1. **The genitive** — one sprig. The frame is already installed (`des` = D- + *seiner*); it needs stating, not building.
2. **The passive** — out of declared scope. Listed for the promise, not as a task.

Everything marked **partial** is a one-sentence fix: move a footnote or trap note into the pattern card so the law is named where the learner looks, rather than where an auditor looks.

## Keeping this file honest

The `status` column is a judgement call, so it needs a check that fails loudly. `src/tests/tm6-ideas.test.ts` asserts the inverse direction — that every lesson named here exists, and that the structures this document marks `taught` really do have a lesson. Run it after any content change:

```bash
bun run test
```
